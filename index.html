  I am currently the Scheduler Architect with the Partnership for an Advanced Computing Environment (PACE) at Georgia
  Tech. Previously, I was a member of the Outreach and Faculty Interaction team with PACE, having joined in 2019 
  after finishing my Phd at the University of Kentucky, where I conducted precision studies of free-neutron and 
  nuclear beta decay.
  My main research interests include the integration of novel computing architectures into community-driven 
  infrastructure such as schedulers and gateways, as well as orchestrating user and administrative workflows through
  said infrastructures and systems-level functionality. I am also interested in architecture-specific algorithm
  optimization and green computing.
